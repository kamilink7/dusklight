This was mainly a fun side project for me as someone who is pretty new to C++ and was, until about two weeks ago, completely unfamiliar with the decomp code. I started this intending just to see what I could do and how much I could do on my own, but I also saw a lot of people in the Dusklight discord asking for some of these features, so I decided to release it as a mod/custom build.

Main features:
- Option in Dusklight menu difficulty section that allows you to control how much damage Link's sword can do

- Option in Dusklight gameplay menu that will keep the sword and shield visible on Wolf Link's back
  
  >_This will inevitably cause clipping with Midna's model. Will work on an option to toggle her visibility on/off soon._

- Manual shielding (no toggle option yet)
  
  >_Shield attack is now R+B, text changes to reflect this coming soon_

- Crouch shielding (no toggle option yet)
  
  >_Restored an unused animation, applies when holding R and not targeting (same as older games)_

- Extended Wolf Link finishers/Ending Blow

  >_You can now perform ending blow on most common enemies as Wolf Link!_

- Restart from the beginning of an area/dungeon upon death rather than beginning of a room (no toggle option yet)
  
  >_Older games in the series already did this, which I thought would be an appropriate change given TP's already piss easy difficulty_

- Lose rupees on death
  
  >_Optional toggle under difficulty section, lose half of Link's rupees on death (except some events, for now)_

- sudafed's No Hitstop toggle

  >_Optional toggle under gameplay section, turn off the brief frame pause when Link lands an attack_

Known issues:
- After performing a finisher/ending blow on an enemy as Wolf Link, you may be unable to jump attack until you perform a regular B attack or other action
  >_UPDATE: This has been fixed and will be included in the next update._

Planned features:
- Toggle options for features that do not currently have them
  
  >_Just makes sense to include this with the sword+shield visibility option._

- Z Button Items (Almost done)

  >_The QOL feature that everybody asks for. This is what is taking the most time and attention right now because Nintendo devs were smoking crack when they made this game._

- Whatever else I think of on a whim

# Overview

Dusklight is a reverse-engineered reimplementation of Twilight Princess.

It aims to be as accurate as possible to the original while also providing new options, enhancements, and tools to customize your experience.

# Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dusklight does *not* provide any copyrighted assets. You must provide your own copy of the original game.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At a minimum, Dusklight requires a GPU with support for D3D12, Vulkan 1.1+, or Metal. For older devices, best-effort support is provided for D3D11 and OpenGL ES (Android), but will not achieve full accuracy or performance. Your experience with specific hardware, operating systems, and drivers may vary.

### 1. Dump your game

You must dump your own copy of the game. Please see [this article](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Ripping_Games) for instructions. After dumping, you can use a program like [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/) or [nodtool](https://github.com/encounter/nod/releases) to convert the `.iso` to `.rvz` to save space.

Currently, only the GameCube releases are supported. Support for other versions of the game is planned in the future.

### 2. Install Dusklight

Visit the [official installation guide](https://twilitrealm.dev/install/) for full instructions.

# Building

If you'd like to build Dusklight from source, please read the [build instructions](docs/building.md).

Pull requests are welcomed! Note that we do not accept contributions that are primarily AI-generated and will close your PR if we suspect as much. Please also see the [code conventions](docs/code-conventions.md).
